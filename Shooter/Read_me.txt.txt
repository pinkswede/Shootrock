Assignment 2, ShootRock

Name: Ciaran Lynch

About:

Shootrock is a game in which a player controls a spaceship that traverses through outer space
In order to survive, the player must avoid hitting rocks. They are able to do this by dodging
rocks or shooting at them in order to destroy them. Once a rock has been destroyed, it will
break into 'shards' which are represented as coins, that the player must then collect to gain
points. If the player is able to collect multiple coins quickly after one another, they will
gain a bonus of +10 points for every new shard they collect. Once the player collides with a
rock, the game ends, and the player is returned to the start screen.
